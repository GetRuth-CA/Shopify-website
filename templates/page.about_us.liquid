    <br />
    <div style="font-size: 18px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; line-height: 35px;">The name Ruth is special
      to us because we wanted to pay tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a powerful role model who fought for justice,
      equality, and female empowerment. RBG stood for women equality and fought her way to try and eliminate social
      injustices. We, at Ruth, are ruthlessly fighting with you to save the Earth one sustainable product at a time.
      <br /><br /> Ruth is also a symbol of generosity and kindness - in alignment with our goals of giving back to the
      women, girls, and people who menstruate, in most need of menstrual products. Together, let’s solve period poverty
      one menstrual pad at a time. <br /><br /> We want to make sustainable periods easy, and we hope you can join us.

      <div style="display:block;font-size: 18px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; line-height: 35px;">Nicole and
        Anka met at the University of Alberta in 2018 when they joined Enactus - a student group focused on social
        entrepreneurship. They led a project aimed at tackling menstrual waste and launched initiatives to open up
        conversations surrounding menstruation, sustainable periods, and worked to create sustainable menstrual products
        from the lab bench. Nearly three years of prototyping and planning led them to launch their company Ruth in
        January 2021 - an innovative solution to menstrual waste with disposable and biodegradable pads. <br /><br />
        Collectively, they have been supported as female founders and trained through Founder Institute, NEXT 36, and
        the League of Innovators. Ruth is proudly backed by Community Foundations Canada and NEXT Canada.</div>

        She/her | Co-founder<br /><br />

        Nicole has always wanted to make a positive impact, and she thought that starting with a business degree with
        the hopes of later pursuing law would enable her to do that. When she came across a project wanting to create a
        sustainable alternative to menstrual pads while empowering womxn at the same time, she was introduced to the
        world of entrepreneurship. As she continued to develop the project and helped turn it into a business, she was
        shocked to find out the realities associated with menstruation - the amount of waste produced, the lack of
        innovation, the stigma, and the lack of education. Driven by her personal values and Ruth’s mission and vision,
        she leads the team in executing their marketing strategy and business development.

        She/her | Co-founder<br /><br />

        Anka is a science lover whose Neuroscience journey transformed once she was introduced to the world of
        sustainable menstruation. She began innovating on novel menstrual biodegradable menstrual pads, backed by her
        interdisciplinary lab experience. Understanding that period waste is a huge and growing issue, but personally
        finding it difficult to use the reusable menstrual products led her to launch Ruth. She has a huge heart for
        underserved communities and seeks to give back to those in most need. She contributes to Ruth’s mission of
        making sustainable periods easy through continuous product development and business strategizing.
